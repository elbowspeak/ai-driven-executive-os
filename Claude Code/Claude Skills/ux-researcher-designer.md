# UX Researcher & Designer

Comprehensive toolkit for user-centered research and experience design.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Data-Driven Persona Generation

- Document characteristics
- Create scenarios
- Extract design implications

**Step 4: Validation**
- Review with stakeholders
- Test with real users
- Refine based on feedback
- Assign confidence scores based on sample size

#### Persona Template

- What are you testing?
- What questions need answers?
- Success criteria?

**Select Method**:
- Moderated vs unmoderated
- Remote vs in-person
- Think-aloud protocol
- Task-based testing
- A/B testing

**Recruit Participants**:
- Target 5-8 users per round
- Match persona criteria
- Appropriate screener questions

#### Test Structure

**Introduction** (5 min):
- Welcome and consent
- Explain process
- Set expectations

**Pre-test Questions** (5 min):
- Background information
- Current behavior
- Expectations

**Tasks** (20-30 min):
- 3-5 realistic scenarios
- Observe and take notes
- Ask follow-up questions

**Post-test Questions** (10 min):
- Overall impressions
- Satisfaction ratings
- Suggestions

**Debrief** (5 min):
- Thank participant
- Clarify any questions

#### Metrics to Track

**Behavioral Metrics**:
- Task success rate
- Time on task
- Error rate
- Number of clicks/steps
- Help requests

**Attitudinal Metrics**:
