```

## Analysis Logic

### **Scan Past Week**

**Daily Notes Pattern:**
Look for files matching date pattern from last 7 days:
- Count how many exist (daily note habit)
- Extract todos and check completion
- Identify recurring themes or mentions
- Track which days were productive

**Modified Files:**
Check what files were modified in last 7 days:
- Portfolio company updates
- Contact interactions
- Project progress
- New ideas or research

### **Calculate Metrics**

**Portfolio Engagement:**
- Which companies' files were modified?
- How many days since each was touched?
- Board meetings or major events?

**Relationship Activity:**
- Contacts added or updated
- Last_contact dates in last 7 days
- New introductions made

**Time Allocation (estimate):**
- Based on files modified and content
- Consulting hours if tracked
- Meeting notes and interactions

### **Trend Analysis**

**Week-over-Week:**
- More/less portfolio engagement?
- Network activity up/down?
- Revenue work consistent?
- Strategic work happening?

**Patterns:**
- Which day of week most productive?
- What types of work getting done?
- What's being neglected?

### **Forward Planning**

**Intelligent Suggestions:**

If portfolio company needs attention:
- "ConfigHub board meeting next Thursday - start prep Wednesday"

If relationship health declining:
- "3 strong relationships dormant > 60 days - prioritize reconnection"

If consulting revenue low:
- "Only X hours this week - pipeline concern? Client check-ins needed?"

If no strategic work:
- "No idea/research progress - schedule thinking time"

**PAI System Check:**
- Run `bash Scripts/automation/check-pai-updates.sh` to check for new PAI features
- Review the generated report at `Daily/PAI-Updates-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Suggest 1-2 new features to integrate based on current workflow needs

## Interactive Elements

**Ask questions to make planning specific:**
- "What's your #1 goal for next week?"
- "Which portfolio company needs most attention?"
- "How many consulting hours committed next week?"
- "Any big meetings or deadlines to plan around?"

**Offer tailored suggestions:**
- Based on last week's accomplishments
- Based on gaps or missed items
- Based on upcoming events
- Based on portfolio status

## Important Notes

- Be honest but constructive about incomplete items
- Celebrate wins explicitly
- Provide specific, actionable next steps
- Balance reflection with forward planning
- Adapt tone: end-of-week = reflective, start-of-week = motivational
- Keep metrics simple and actionable
- Connect weekly priorities to longer-term goals
- Suggest one habit improvement per week
- End with clear, confidence-building next actions

## Usage Pattern

**Best Times:**
- **Friday afternoon (3-5pm):** Week winding down, reflective mindset
- **Monday morning (9-10am):** Fresh start, planning mindset

**Frequency:**
- Weekly (ideally Friday)
- Can run Monday if Friday was missed
- Can run mid-week for course correction

**Paired With:**
- Run `/portfolio-update` before `/weekly` if portfolio focus week
- Run `/relationship-health` monthly in addition to weekly
- Run `/daily` every other day minimum for best weekly review data
