# Idea Archive

Move validated ideas from "someday/maybe" to active execution with concrete project plans.

## Instructions

When the user runs `/idea-archive [idea]`, create a comprehensive execution plan and move the idea from planning to action.

## Usage

```
/idea-archive AI-powered portfolio reporting tool
/idea-archive content series on agentic AI
/idea-archive consulting service for early-stage startups
/idea-archive [idea that's been validated and matched]
```

## Purpose

Ideas die in the "validated" stage. This command:
- Creates concrete execution plan with milestones
- Moves idea to `Ideas/In_Execution/` folder
- Tracks progress from start to launch
- Ensures follow-through (not just planning)

**Use this command when:**
- Idea scored >20 in `/idea-validate`
- Found strong matches in `/idea-match`
- You're committed to executing (not just exploring)

## Execution Framework

### 1. **Define Success**
- What does "done" look like?
- How do you measure success?
- What's the minimum viable version?

### 2. **Break Down Phases**
- Research/Validation phase
- Build/Create phase
- Launch/Ship phase
- Iterate/Scale phase (if applicable)

### 3. **Create Timeline**
- Realistic milestones with dates
- Weekly commitments
- Dependencies and blockers

### 4. **Assign Resources**
- Who's involved (including you)
- What tools/systems needed
- Budget allocated

### 5. **Track Progress**
- Weekly check-ins (built into `/daily`)
- Milestone completion tracking
- Pivot signals (when to adjust)

*Project archived and moved to execution: [Date]*
*Check `/daily` for automated reminders and progress tracking*
*Update this document weekly - every Friday recommended*
*Ship, learn, iterate. Execution beats planning.*
```

## Usage Notes

### When to Use This Command

**✅ Use `/idea-archive` when:**
- Idea scored >20 in validation
- Found strong matches in idea-match
- You're committed to executing
- You have capacity (time, resources)
- Timing is right

**❌ Don't use yet if:**
- Idea scored <15 in validation
- No clear execution path
- Too many unknowns
- Timing is wrong
- Already too many active projects

### After Archiving

**The project is now active:**
1. Appears in your `/daily` briefs (automated tracking)
2. Surfaces if no progress for 7+ days (accountability)
3. Flags when milestones approaching (time management)
4. Weekly check-in reminders built in

**Your job:**
- Update this document weekly (Fridays recommended)
- Check off completed tasks
- Note blockers and learnings
- Celebrate milestones

## Integration with Other Commands

### This command combines insights from:
- `/idea-validate` - Success criteria and metrics
- `/idea-match` - Who to involve, portfolio connections
- `/find-connections` - Network activation
- `/project-status` - Progress tracking (if consulting)

### Future commands will reference this:
- `/daily` - Surfaces active projects
- `/weekly` - Reviews project progress
- Content creation commands - Document execution

## Example Workflow

```
User: /idea-archive AI-powered portfolio reporting tool

You:
1. Pull data from validation: Scored 26/30 (strong opportunity)
2. Pull data from matching: ConfigHub, DataFlint want this; 3 consultants could use
3. Create execution plan:
   - Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Validate requirements with 5 users
   - Phase 2 (Weeks 3-6): Build MVP for own 7 companies
   - Phase 3 (Weeks 7-8): Expand to 2 consulting clients
   - Phase 4 (Weeks 9-12): Pitch to EncodedVC as proof of concept
4. Define success: "Saves 5+ hrs/week, 2 clients willing to pay, EncodedVC interested"
5. Set milestones with dates
6. Identify risks and contingencies
7. Document connections (who's helping, who's using)
8. Save to: Ideas/In_Execution/AI_Portfolio_Reporting_Project_2025-11-12.md
9. Move original idea from Ideas/Validated/ to Ideas/In_Execution/

Project now appears in /daily briefs.
Update weekly. Ship in 8 weeks.
```
