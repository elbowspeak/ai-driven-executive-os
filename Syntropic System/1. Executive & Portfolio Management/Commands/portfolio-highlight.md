## Writing Guidelines

### **Authentic > Promotional**

**Good - Authentic:**
"Working with Tenzai has taught me that the best founders aren't afraid to challenge their investors' assumptions. When I suggested they focus on enterprise first, they showed me data proving developer-led growth was the right move. They were right."

**Avoid - Promotional:**
"So excited to announce our portfolio company Tenzai is crushing it! Best team ever! 🚀🔥 So lucky to work with them!"

### **Specific > Generic**

**Good - Specific:**
"ConfigHub went from 50 to 500 customers in 8 months by doing one counterintuitive thing: they stopped trying to be everything to everyone and focused exclusively on configuration management for microservices."

**Avoid - Generic:**
"ConfigHub is growing fast by focusing on their customers and building a great product."

### **Insight > Update**

**Good - Insight:**
"Neurometric's journey illustrates a pattern I'm seeing across AI companies: the ones winning aren't the ones with the best models, they're the ones with the best data pipelines and operational discipline."

**Avoid - Update:**
"Happy to share that Neurometric just raised their Series A! Congrats to the team on this milestone!"

### **Show Value-Add > Claim It**

**Good - Show:**
"When DataFlint was deciding between usage-based and seat-based pricing, we built financial models for both scenarios. The data showed usage-based would unlock 3x expansion revenue. Six months later, that prediction is holding true."

**Avoid - Claim:**
"We provide tremendous value to our portfolio companies through strategic guidance and hands-on support."

## Content Calendar Strategy

### **Frequency:**
- Highlight 1-2 portfolio companies per month
- Rotate through portfolio (don't over-feature any one company)
- Align with their milestones when possible
- Mix content types (not all achievement posts)

### **Rotation:**
Track in `Content/Portfolio_Highlight_Schedule.md`:
```markdown
## 2025 Highlights

**Q4:**
- November: [[Tenzai]] - Market insight post (agentic AI validation)
- December: [[XORQ]] - Founder journey (pivot story)

**2026 Q1:**
- January: [[ConfigHub]] - Achievement (500 customer milestone)
- February: [[Neurometric]] - Working with reflection (1 year)
- March: [[DataFlint]] - Problem-solution (data quality challenges)

**Q2:**
- April: [[Datum]] - Market insight (data infrastructure trends)
- May: [[IPXO]] - Achievement (major customer win)
- June: [[Tenzai]] - Founder journey (hiring story)
```

### **Opportunistic Highlights:**
Be ready to create content when:
- Company announces funding
- Major customer win
- Product launch
- Significant milestone
- Founder does something notable
- Market event validates their approach

## Integration with Portfolio Management

### **After each board meeting:**
Consider if there's:
- Achievement worth highlighting
- Insight worth sharing
- Milestone to celebrate
- Lesson to document

### **Monthly portfolio review:**
Run `/portfolio-update` and identify:
- Which companies have momentum
- Which need visibility boost
- Which have recent wins to celebrate
- Which provide market insights

### **Coordinate with founders:**
- Ask: "Any milestones coming up worth highlighting?"
- Offer: "Would you like visibility on X achievement?"
- Collaborate: "Let's co-create content around Y"

## Value to Portfolio Companies

**Direct value:**
- Visibility to potential customers
- Credibility (investor endorsement)
- Talent attraction
- Partnership opportunities
- Press attention (reporters follow investors)

**Network effects:**
- Your audience becomes their audience
- Warm intros from engagement
- Cross-portfolio connections
- Investor/founder community awareness

**Morale boost:**
- Recognition for hard work
- External validation
- Team motivation
- Recruitment tool ("Our investor wrote this about us")

## Important Notes

- **Celebrate, don't brag:** Make it about them, not you
- **Be genuine:** Only highlight what you truly believe
- **Protect confidentiality:** Get approval for sensitive info
- **Show don't tell:** Specific examples > vague praise
- **Add insight:** What can readers learn beyond "company is great"?
- **Time it well:** Coordinate with company's announcements
- **Engage deeply:** Respond to comments, facilitate intros
- **Track impact:** Did this actually help the company?
- **Rotate fairly:** Don't over-feature favorite companies
- **Stay authentic:** Your voice, your real observations

## Tips for Great Portfolio Highlights

1. **Make it about insight, not ego:** Readers should learn something
2. **Be specific with examples:** "40% QoQ growth" > "growing fast"
3. **Tell a story:** Journey, challenge, solution more engaging than facts
4. **Show your value-add:** Demonstrate, don't claim
5. **Rotate portfolio:** Every company deserves spotlight
6. **Time it strategically:** Align with company's goals and timing
7. **Collaborate with founders:** Make them co-creators
8. **Track what works:** Learn from engagement patterns
9. **Be authentic:** False enthusiasm is obvious and off-putting
10. **End with value:** What should reader remember or do?
