### During Diligence

## Scoring Framework

Rate each category 1-5:
- Market opportunity

**Total > 30:** Strong opportunity, pursue
**Total 25-30:** Interesting, dig deeper

## Key Questions

For every investment, answer:
1. **Why will this be huge?** (Market opportunity)
2. **Why will they win?** (Competitive advantage)
3. **Why this team?** (Founder-market fit)
4. **Why now?** (Timing)
5. **Why us?** (Your edge as investor)

If you can't answer all five confidently, dig deeper or pass.

- **Note assumptions:** Make them explicit so you can test later
