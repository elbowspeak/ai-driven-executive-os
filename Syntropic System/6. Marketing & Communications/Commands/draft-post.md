## Content Types & Approaches

### **1. Market Analysis Post**
Format:
- Hook: Surprising market data or trend
- Insight: What it means, why it matters
- Implication: How founders/investors should think about it
- Close: Question or prediction

Example hook:
"The agentic AI security market just hit an inflection point. Here's what 15 funding rounds in 60 days tells us..."

### **2. Portfolio Lesson Post**
Format:
- Hook: Specific situation from portfolio work
- Challenge: What made it hard/interesting
- Insight: What you learned (generalizable)
- Takeaway: How others can apply it

Example hook:
"Watching a portfolio company navigate a pivot taught me more about product-market fit than any framework ever could."

### **3. Contrarian Take Post**
Format:
- Hook: State the conventional wisdom
- Challenge: Why it's incomplete or wrong
- Evidence: Data/examples supporting your view
- Nuance: Acknowledge when conventional wisdom does apply

Example hook:
"Everyone says 'move fast and break things.' But I've seen more startups die from speed than slowness. Here's why..."

### **4. Trend Spotting Post**
Format:
- Hook: Pattern you're seeing (3+ data points)
- Analysis: Why it's happening now
- Prediction: Where it's headed
- Action: What to do about it

Example hook:
"Three portfolio companies just got the same customer objection. This isn't coincidence—it's a market shift."

### **5. Question/Discussion Post**
Format:
- Hook: Provocative question
- Context: Why you're asking (what prompted it)
- Your take: Your current thinking (not definitive)
- Invitation: Genuinely want others' perspectives

Example hook:
"How do you know when to double down vs. when to pivot? I'm wrestling with this for two portfolio companies right now."

### **6. Data-Driven Post**
Format:
- Hook: Surprising statistic or research finding
- Context: Where it comes from, why credible
- Interpretation: What it actually means (avoid obvious)
- Application: How to use this insight

Example hook:
"Only 12% of AI security companies focus on agentic systems. Yet 78% of security leaders say it's their top concern. The disconnect is massive."

### **7. Resource Share Post**
Format:
- Hook: Why this resource matters
- Summary: Key takeaways (save reader time)
- Application: How you're using it
- Link: Where to find it

Example hook:
"This market map changed how I evaluate deals in the data infrastructure space. Three insights that stuck with me..."

## Research & Validation

### **Before writing:**

**Check vault for:**
- Portfolio company notes (relevant learnings?)
- Research documents (supporting data?)
- Contact notes (interesting conversations?)
- Consulting projects (applicable lessons?)

**Web search for:**
- Recent news/data on topic
- What others are saying (to differentiate)
- Data to support your points
- Validate your thesis isn't outdated

**Consider:**
- Is this insight actually valuable?
- Am I the right person to share this?
- Is timing right for this topic?
- Who's the audience for this?

## Integration with Vault

### **After posting:**
- Save to `Content/LinkedIn/[Date]_[Topic].md`
- Tag with relevant topics
- Link to portfolio companies mentioned
- Track engagement (update with comment count, shares)
- Note what worked/didn't for future posts

### **Content calendar:**
- Keep list of potential topics in `Content/Post_Ideas.md`
- Aim for 2-3 posts per week
- Mix content types (not all the same format)
- Reference portfolio developments when appropriate

## Voice Examples

### **Good - Your Voice:**
"Working with seven portfolio companies has shown me something counterintuitive: the best founders aren't the ones with all the answers. They're the ones who ask the right questions and listen carefully to the answers."

### **Avoid - Too Salesy:**
"Excited to announce our portfolio company XYZ just raised $10M! So proud of this amazing team! 🚀🎉"

### **Good - Your Voice:**
"The difference between a $10M company and a $100M company often comes down to one decision: knowing when to say no. Here's what I've learned about strategic focus from working with high-growth startups..."

### **Avoid - Too Generic:**
"Startups need to focus. Focus is important. Here are 5 tips for staying focused."

### **Good - Your Voice:**
"Three portfolio companies just pivoted their pricing models. All three went from per-seat to usage-based. This isn't random—it's a signal about how enterprise buying behavior is changing."

## Advanced Techniques

### **Pattern Recognition:**
Look across portfolio for patterns:
- Common customer objections
- Similar pivots or decisions
- Shared challenges
- Emerging trends

These make great posts (specific examples, generalizable insight).

### **Data Storytelling:**
Use research commands to gather data:
- `/market-map [category]` for landscape insights
- `/competitive-analysis [company]` for competitive dynamics
- `/portfolio-update` for cross-portfolio patterns

Turn research into narrative.

### **Thought Leadership Positioning:**
Over time, establish expertise in:
- AI/security (Tenzai, Neurometric)
- Data infrastructure (DataFlint, IPXO)
- Developer tools (ConfigHub, XORQ)
- B2B SaaS operations (across portfolio)

Consistent, valuable content in these areas builds credibility.

## Important Notes

- **Authenticity > Polish:** Better to sound like yourself than like a marketing team
- **Value > Promotion:** Share insights, not updates (unless major news)
- **Specific > Generic:** Real examples beat platitudes every time
- **Questions > Answers:** Invite discussion, don't just broadcast
- **Consistency > Perfection:** Regular valuable posts beat occasional viral ones
- **Portfolio = Proof:** You have real examples—use them (with appropriate discretion)

## Examples Workflow

```
User: /draft-post agentic AI security market observations

You:
1. Check vault for Tenzai notes, competitive analyses
2. Search for recent market data

   - Version 2: Portfolio insight (lessons from Tenzai journey)
   - Version 3: Contrarian (why current approaches miss the point)
5. Include engagement strategy
6. Suggest follow-up content ideas

## Tips for Great Posts

1. **Start with reader benefit:** Why should they care?
2. **Be specific:** "3 companies" beats "many companies"
3. **Show, don't tell:** Examples > assertions
4. **Respect reader's time:** Get to the point, then support it
5. **End with action:** What should reader think/do/consider?
6. **Use portfolio ethically:** Share learnings, not confidential info
7. **Iterate:** First draft rarely best—generate multiple versions
8. **Test hooks:** Try 3-5 different openings, pick strongest
9. **Read aloud:** If it doesn't sound like you speaking, revise
10. **Post regularly:** Algorithm and audience reward consistency
