## Example Workflow

```
User: /research AI reasoning models

You:
1. Search web for recent developments
2. Find: OpenAI o1, Anthropic Claude with extended thinking, research papers
3. Identify trends: "Reasoning collapse", chain-of-thought, agentic approaches
4. Link to portfolio: neurometric (reasoning analytics)
5. Compile findings into structured document
6. Save to: Research/AI_Reasoning_Models_Research_2025-11-12.md
7. Suggest: "/competitive-analysis neurometric" to see how they fit landscape

Key findings:
- Market moving toward explicit reasoning (o1, Claude)
- Challenges: reasoning collapse, cost, latency
- Opportunity: Tools to optimize when reasoning helps/hurts
- neurometric positioned well for this trend

Research complete!
Next: Share with neurometric team? Update their analysis?
